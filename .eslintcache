I have worked as a professional for may years in a client facing role. I have always been interested in the technolgy used at the companies I have worked for. I am pursuing a certification from the SMU BootCamp program to see where it takes me.</p>\n                                        <p>I was born and raised in Minnesota. Yes, the winters are cold and I don't miss them. I do miss the 'lake life'. Being able to go for a swim or enjoy the water on the 10,000 lakes, is easy to love. My favorite place is outdoors.  I like to camp, hike, cycle, SUP, and many other outdoor activities. Minnesota has lots birch trees making hiking even more pretty. If I am not being active, reading a book on the patio with a glass of red wine is a nice way to spend an evening.</p>\n                                        <p>I have a knack for organizing. I am excited to be a developer because it will allow me to creatively solve problems in an organized fashion. I have years of experience working directly with clients. I know this will benefit me in my developer career. I understand there is never just one stakeholder. The enduser, the client, the broker, the Account Manager, all have an opinion. I am able to listen to someone tell me what they think they want and ask valuable leading questions to understand what they actually need. I am ready to take my client facing, requirements gathering, soft skills to actually create the product.</p>\n                                        <p>Hopeful of the position of Front-End Developer that gives room for the utilization of exceptional communication and growth. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from Southern Methodist University. Newly developed skills in HTML, CSS, various CSS frameworks, and JavaScript. With most of my career in a client facing role, I have experience in requirements gathering, meeting deadlines, balancing priorities, and project management. Being the liaison between external and internal stakeholders, I have worked on agile teams to complete and present projects. Due to the uniqueness of the client set I was assigned, I have worked closely with technology teams. Being able to observe made me realize my true passion of working in the technology space.</p>\n                                    \n                                        <p>Link to resume <a href={Resume}> here!  </a> </p>\n                                        <p>Link to LinkedIn <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinrenneke/\">here! </a></p>\n                                    </div>\n\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n        </>\n    )\n\n}\n\nexport default homePage;","/Users/robinrenneke/Desktop/reactPortfolio/src/components/nav.js",[],"/Users/robinrenneke/Desktop/reactPortfolio/src/pages/portfolio.js",[],"/Users/robinrenneke/Desktop/reactPortfolio/src/components/footer.js",[],"/Users/robinrenneke/Desktop/reactPortfolio/src/components/header.js",[],"/Users/robinrenneke/Desktop/reactPortfolio/src/components/card.js",[],{"ruleId":"50","replacedBy":"51"},{"ruleId":"52","replacedBy":"53"},{"ruleId":"54","severity":1,"message":"55","line":1,"column":8,"nodeType":"56","messageId":"57","endLine":1,"endColumn":12},{"ruleId":"58","severity":1,"message":"59","line":17,"column":29,"nodeType":"60","endLine":17,"endColumn":97},{"ruleId":"58","severity":1,"message":"59","line":21,"column":29,"nodeType":"60","endLine":21,"endColumn":97},{"ruleId":"58","severity":1,"message":"59","line":25,"column":29,"nodeType":"60","endLine":25,"endColumn":99},"no-native-reassign",["61"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["62"],"no-unused-vars","'logo' is defined but never used.","Identifier","unusedVar","jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt","Redundant alt attribute.
